    <h1>Health Systems Science I</h1>
    <h2>Module 1: Week 1 - Session 5</h2>

        <div class="part">
            <h2>Activity 1.5.1: Understanding the Question</h2>
            <p>This activity is broken down into two steps that will help you understand what is required of you in Course Paper 1. Make sure that you have read your brief before completing this activity.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 1: Highlighting key instructions and key words</h3>
            <p>The three parts of your essay are written below. Each part of your essay has an instruction and keywords linked to it. Use the text ‘highlight colour function’ on the home tab to highlight the instruction words <span class="highlight-yellow">yellow</span> and the keywords <span class="highlight-green">green</span>:</p>

            <p>For this assignment, you will be required to answer the question <span class="highlight-green">can there be a universal definition of health?</span> Using your personal definition of health, your personal experience of accessing health care and in relation to the core content covered in the course so far, you will also reflect on <span class="highlight-green">whether a universal definition of health is useful and necessary</span>. The assignment can be seen as consisting of two parts:</p>

            <h4>PART 1:</h4>
            <p><span class="highlight-yellow">Revisiting your reflective narrative</span> describing an experience of seeking health care. For the first part of this assignment, you will need to revisit and refine your reflective narrative in which you recounted a personal experience of accessing health care, and in which you related this experience to your subjective definition of health. You need to situate the central question of this assignment- <span class="highlight-green">can there be a universal definition of health</span> and whether it is useful and necessary- in relation to your personal narrative of accessing health care. Your narrative should be refined in relation to the <span class="highlight-green">core themes or content areas</span> that your personal narrative elicits.</p>

            <h4>PART 2:</h4>
            <p>The second part of this assignment is a more detailed, academically sound discussion on the main question in relation to the themes or content areas you have highlighted in part 1. You need to outline the <span class="highlight-green">main arguments</span> being made in support of your views, and you might also want to consider the <span class="highlight-green">counter arguments</span> to the points you raise. The emphasis here is to develop a detailed discussion on whether or not a universal definition of health is possible, necessary, and useful. In this section, you need to bring in <span class="highlight-green">textual evidence</span> to support the claims or observations you have made. As with any academic activity, it is important to relate your assertions, views and statements to a broader literature on the issues that you raise. You are required to read around the issues that you raise in your reflection, and to make reference to other writers and thinkers who address relevant or similar issues. You could look at the topics raised in class and include readings from the references cited at the end of the lecture slides. You should have a <span class="highlight-green">minimum of 5 sources</span> in your assignment.</p>

            <p>Make sure you understand all the words you have highlighted, if there is a word you do not understand, make sure to look it up in a dictionary if it is not included in the list of words on the session on uLwazi. The words you have highlighted in yellow, should tell you what to do. And the words highlighted in green, give you vital information about how to do this.</p>
            <p>Once you have thought about or investigated each highlighted word, then you should be able to make sense of the question and understand exactly what is expected in your essay.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Paraphrasing the question</h3>
            <h4>Part 1:</h4>
            <p>In this assignment, it requires me to revisit and refine my personal narrative about my experience I had when I was accessing healthcare. From the experience I shared, I must explore the idea that there can be universal definition of health. I should describe how my experience relates to my understanding of health. This narrative reflection must link to the key themes and topics that we covered in class.</p>

            <h4>Part 2:</h4>
            <p>In this section, I must write a detailed, well-supported discussion about whether there can be a universal definition of health. I must evaluate my claim with relation to the concepts and themes I covered from the course. From that claim, I must analyze different arguments that may oppose or support my claim of a universal definition of health with references from other relevant literature (minimum of 5).</p>
