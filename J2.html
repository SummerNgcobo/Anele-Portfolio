        <h1>Reflection on South African Indigenous Views on Health</h1>
        
        <h2>My Definition of Health</h2>
        <p>Health is a sense of perception and acceptance of each individual on different domains (physical, social, mental, etc.) of life which correlates to his/her values and personality.</p>
        
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p>People have different views about health which must not be influenced by other people. For example, someone can see him or herself healthy at a certain weight, which might feel unhealthy to someone else. This refers to the physical domain of life. Another example is that spirituality plays an important role in some individuals' well-being, while for others it does not. In summary, we cannot define individual health based on our experiences. Something that I view as normal may not be normal for another person. I suggest health be defined in a holistic manner, not specifying certain domains but including every domain. For example, in the WHO (1946) health definition dilemma, some people argue for the exclusion of spirituality. Perhaps those who arranged that definition did not see the impact of spirituality on individual well-being.</p>

        <h2>1. Fundamental Concepts in Traditional Healing Health Beliefs</h2>
        <p>Traditional healing addresses the physical, spiritual, mental, and emotional domains of well-being when defining health. The WHO (1946) addresses physical, mental, and social domains, excluding spirituality.</p>

        <h2>2. Unusual Aspects of Traditional Healing Beliefs</h2>
        <p>As an African who practices traditional African healing, which greatly impacts my state of well-being, I didn’t find anything unusual. However, people practicing Western religion may find it unusual to pray to ancestors for messages to and from God. The use of animals as sacrifices in rituals may also seem superstitious. The conflict of interest between African and Western religions illustrates that health is socially constructed, given that these religions originated in different regions.</p>

        <h2>3. Similarities with My Concepts of Health</h2>
        <p>Both perspectives include the social domain. Some conditions are interpreted differently across societies. For example, an individual experiencing mental delusions and hallucinations may be viewed as having schizophrenia in Western society, requiring medical intervention, whereas in African society, those symptoms may be seen as a calling by the ancestors, necessitating a ritual. In both societies, social support from family and community is crucial for coping, despite differing analyses of the condition.</p>

        <h2>4. Differences with My Concepts of Health</h2>
        <p>I feel health is defined based on someone's view, such as that of a traditional doctor (sangoma). For example, diagnoses may come from ancestors through a sangoma, which I could view as normal. However, this can be biased based on the traditional healer's worldview and experiences. In my view, delusions or hallucinations may be interpreted as a disconnection from spirituality with ancestors. I advocate for the inclusion of all aspects or domains of life based on individual views, recognizing that perceptions vary. My definition aligns with the paper's view but emphasizes inclusivity of diverse perspectives on health.</p>

        <h2>5. Obstacles to Critical Thinking</h2>
        <p>There’s no significant difference between traditional healing beliefs and my own. I prefer traditional medicine as a first option before scientific medication. Being exposed to both African and Western medicine, I believe collaboration in healthcare can lead to optimal well-being. Practitioners in both fields should possess knowledge of each practice, which can aid in early diagnoses and improved patient well-being.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>Health system thinking must be central to the collaboration of African traditional healing and Western medical practices to include everyone, leading to optimal healthcare service. Public health initiatives should educate the public about these practices and their collaboration. Ethics and laws should regulate this process, ensuring practitioners work within their expertise and refer patients appropriately. Patients should be central in decision-making to avoid violations of human rights. Ultimately, self-perception must be considered; we should not decide for individuals.</p>
