        <h4>Step 1B: Scanning</h4>
        <p>1. Key concepts/ideas found in these sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>WHO (1946) definition of health</li>
            <li>Chronic illness</li>
            <li>Alternative health definitions</li>
        </ul>
        <p>2. Will this text help you write on the topic you are reading it for? <strong>Yes</strong></p>

        <h3>Part 2: Questioning</h3>
        <p>1. Questions about the text or your topic:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is the current definition of health?</li>
            <li>How does the current definition of health exclude chronic ill patients?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Part 3: Reading, Recalling, Reviewing</h3>
        <h4>Step 3A: Reading</h4>
        <p>Answer to your questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Health is defined as the “state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity” (WHO, 1946).</li>
            <li>The health can never be complete; chronic ill patients can never be healthy according to the WHO (1946) definition, even if they maintain their health effects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Step 3B: Recall</h4>
        <p>Main points of the selected section:</p>
        <p>WHO (1946) defined health as the complete state of physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease. There are limitations to this definition. One limitation is that health can never be 'complete' as it is influenced by dynamic changes in the environment. Additionally, it is too broad to be measurable for practical application. Alternative definitions have been proposed to relate to the WHO definition.</p>

        <h4>Step 3C: Review</h4>
        <p>Consolidating your learning is crucial. Remembering these points will help you justify your claims in your course paper.</p>
