        <section class="session">
            <h2>Session 1: What is Health Systems Science?</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Health System Sciences (HSS) is defined as the study of components that build up health systems and how health systems function. It complements basic sciences and clinical sciences, regarded as the traditional pillars of health education. It addresses that adequate healthcare service rendered is influenced by factors that support the health system, including Governance, Finance, Service Delivery, Human Resources, Health Information Systems, and Medicines and Technologies. HSS is regarded as the third pillar of health education that must not be underestimated.</p>
            <p>Health system sciences also integrates Public Health, Bioethics, and Health Law. Public Health focuses on the health of populations and how health systems can intervene to meet the needs of diverse groups. Bioethics and Health Law focus on ethics within health science and how laws protect human rights. HSS aims to improve patient experience in healthcare, enhance population health, and reduce the cost of healthcare for accessibility. It involves systems thinking to understand the interconnections of health system components, linking core, cross-cutting, and complementary content.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>I was aware that various systems influence healthcare service delivery, but my understanding was limited. For instance, governance plays a crucial role in decision-making, necessitating systems thinking to consider various factors such as finance and human resources.</p>
            <p>Having a background in environmental health, I recognize the importance of public health and bioethics. For example, ethical considerations are vital when conducting experiments involving humans. My experience in Bushbuckridge highlighted how socioeconomic status impacts health, such as households relying on fuelwood due to financial constraints, leading to health risks like respiratory issues. This reinforces the need for public health to address root causes, not just symptoms, requiring a systems thinking approach.</p>

            <h2>Session 2: Defining Health</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Health is defined by the World Health Organization (1946) as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease. This holistic view includes physical, mental, and social dimensions. However, some argue this definition is idealistic and outdated, especially regarding chronic diseases.</p>
            <p>Alternative definitions suggest health is a dynamic state of well-being that allows individuals to meet life demands, emphasizing resilience and adaptability rather than merely the absence of illness.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>After this lesson, I realized my understanding of health was limited to hospitals and medical professionals, overlooking social dimensions. I support the critiques of WHO's definition, especially regarding chronic disease, as individuals can live healthily despite their conditions.</p>

            <h2>Session 3: Understanding Traditional African Healing</h2>
            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Mokgobi (2014) explores traditional African healing, its history, and its misunderstanding in modern society. It highlights that traditional healing involves herbal medicine and rituals guided by ancestral knowledge. Types of healers include diviners, traditional surgeons, and birth attendants, emphasizing the spiritual dimension absent in the WHO's definition of health.</p>

            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>After this lesson, I noted that I was defining health wrong. I thought it focus only with hospitals, health professionals and patients excluding socially. I support the objections raised by other studies on WHO (1946) health definition. My support is based on less consideration of chronic diseases, people who are living with chronic disease can live healthy live despite of the condition. My support is also stated by Leonardi (2018) that based on WHO (1946) definition people who have chronic disease may never be regarded as health even if they have healthy lifestyle. </p>
