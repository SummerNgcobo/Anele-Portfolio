            <h2>Session 1: Public Health Summary</h2>
            <p>Public health is defined as the intervention of action to improve the health of the population by addressing health concerns that affect the population and developing solutions to prevent those health concerns. It focuses on groups or communities, not individual patients. This involves assessing community living conditions and analyzing potential health problems to prevent them early.</p>
            <p>For example, conducting a survey of environmental conditions can assess access to clean water, proper sanitation, air quality, and other factors. By evaluating these conditions, public health professionals can identify risks, such as waterborne diseases from unsafe drinking water or respiratory diseases caused by poor air quality. Community education and prevention measures are essential in addressing these hazards.</p>
            <p>Effective public health interventions require governance, capacity, advocacy, and information. After implementing interventions, evaluations must be conducted to assess their effectiveness.</p>

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>I was privileged to participate in an environmental sciences project with a group of inspired students, conducting assessments of community living conditions in Masingita village, Bushbuckridge, Mpumalanga. Our analysis revealed a high risk of waterborne and respiratory diseases in the community. During water outages, many households relied on river water as an alternative source. Additionally, nearly 50% of the community used firewood for energy, increasing the risk of respiratory illnesses.</p>
                <p>We conducted awareness campaigns about these health hazards and provided prevention measures, such as water storage in tanks and boiling water before drinking. We also requested the Wits Rural Facility to enhance their initiatives to assist villages in the region. This experience underscored the significant impact of our environment on health. Although our course focused on HIV/AIDS, the principles of public health apply broadly to various contexts.</p>

            <h2>Session 2: The Determinants of Health Summary</h2>
            <p>Determinants of health are various factors that may affect the health of populations. These factors can include biological (e.g., TB, HIV/AIDS), behavioral (e.g., substance abuse), physical (e.g., heat), and social (e.g., airborne diseases from overcrowding). The prevalence of these determinants can change over time; for instance, the infection rates of HIV/AIDS have decreased compared to 2006/2007.</p>
            <p>Human behavior significantly influences health. For example, individuals addicted to substances are at higher risk for liver and kidney diseases. My experience in the forensic field has reinforced this. During autopsies, I observed several cases of lung discoloration associated with smoking, which can be a cause of death. Additionally, many motor vehicle accident victims tested positive for alcohol, linking alcohol consumption to increased accident risk.</p>

                <p>These observations illustrate the critical role of human behavior as a determinant of health. Awareness and education regarding these behaviors can significantly impact public health outcomes.</p>
